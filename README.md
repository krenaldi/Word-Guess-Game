# Word-Guess-Game
Online version of Hangman


## 1. Game starts on load
## 2. Player presses a letter to guess and start the game
## 3. If the letter is in the band name, the letter will appear in the blank slots
## 4. If the letter is not in the band name, the letter will appear below and the user will have one less guess to complete the band name. Player has 8 guesses to win. If player cannot guess the band name in 8 guesses an alert will appear stating they lost and the game will reset.
## 5. Once the band name is complete the player will get an alert stating that the won and the game will reset.

# NOTE: Some band names have spaces in them. The space bar is a valid choice so if there are still blank slots after the band's name is completed, player will need to press the space to complete the band's name.
