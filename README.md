Online version of Hangman


# generate a word at random and store it in a variable
# display the length of the word to the user

# prompt the user to guess a letter
# if the guess is correct increment correct_guesses by 1
# if the guess is incorrect increment incorrect_guesses by 1 
# and draw the next part of the hangman
# if the incorrect_guesses is greater than 8, tell the user 
# they lost and exit the program
